# Create commercial centers using Points of Interest (POI) data.

This README belongs to /docs folder.

There's a lot of open data available about the demographics and geography of the planet. But this information is not necessarily supervised in any particular structure from which insights can be drawn.

The task was to create clusters of distinct commercial centers or markets using points of interest data of a city (the city could be yours). Points of interest (POI) data provides location information of different places along with their defining tags like school, type of outlets, type of building, etc.

POI data refers to the coordinates of any physical entity with a tag describing its type like commercial buildings, schools, hospitals, restaurants, etc.
